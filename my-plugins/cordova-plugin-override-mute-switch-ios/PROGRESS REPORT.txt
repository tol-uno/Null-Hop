Cordova iOS Mute Switch Override Summary

Goal:
I’m building a mobile-only Cordova game that uses the Web Audio API to play sound. I want the game to play audio even when the iOS device's mute switch is turned ON, similar to how many games behave on iPhone.

Problem:
By default, iOS mutes WebView audio (including Web Audio API) when the device's mute switch is ON, even if the audio is playing correctly in JavaScript.

Despite correctly using the Web Audio API in my game (via a custom AudioHandler), audio doesn’t play while the mute switch is active.

Attempted Solution:
We explored creating a custom Cordova plugin to override iOS's mute behavior. The plugin does the following:

Sets the audio session category to AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback using native Objective-C.
Activates the session with [session setActive:YES].
Confirms it’s wired up correctly by sending success callbacks and console logs from both Objective-C and JavaScript.
I named the plugin cordova-plugin-override-mute-switch-ios.

Test Method:
We added a method to the plugin to play a native MP3 file using AVAudioPlayer. A silent version of this file was created to allow continuous playback without audible interference.

We tested:

Playing the file once via JavaScript (OverrideMuteSwitchIOS.playTestSound())
Repeatedly playing it with setInterval()
Setting it to loop indefinitely via Objective-C with audioPlayer.numberOfLoops = -1
The goal was to hold the AVAudioSession open, tricking iOS into allowing Web Audio playback despite the mute switch being on.

Result:
Although the native sound plays perfectly even while the mute switch is on, Web Audio remains muted in the WebView, even with the silent loop running continuously in the background.

This suggests that the active AVAudioSession from native playback does not consistently enable audio playback for Web Audio API in Cordova WebViews — at least not on the test device used.

Status:
As of now, the approach successfully verifies:

The Cordova plugin is functional
Native audio plays while muted
Web Audio remains silent while muted — even when AVAudioSession is held open via a looping native sound
Next Steps (for future ChatGPT sessions):
When I return to this problem, possible follow-ups might include:

Alternative strategies for unmuting Web Audio in iOS WebViews (e.g. WebKit flags, iOS-specific hacks, using native audio for core sounds)
Investigating whether hybrid or Capacitor apps solve this more reliably
Verifying if this issue persists across multiple iOS versions or devices
Embedding audio natively via AVAudioPlayer or integrating audio playback into a custom native view controller.
Exploring use of the Media plugin or background audio permissions as a workaround.
